# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

This lab provides an in-depth analysis of five sorting algorithms by looking at their elapsed runtimes. The five algorithms are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Runtimes were recorded for several values of n in order to compute the time complexity of each algorithm.

## Procedure

1. Each sorting algorithms was timed over ten trials in nanoseconds using the Java method System.nanoTime(). Below is code for the timing mechanism used with each sort.
'''
for(n = 1; n < 10000000; n*10){
        long timeSum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int[] arr = randomArray(n);
            long start = System.nanoTime();
            sort(arr);
            long end = System.nanoTime();
            long elapsed = end â€“ start;
            timeSum += elapsed;
        }
        long timeAvg = timeSum / 10;
        System.out.println("n=" + n + ": " + timeAvg);
    }
